              <p>
              A blockchain is a type of distributed ledger technology (DLT) where a digital ledger records transactions across an entire network that is linked to a particular blockchain. The digital information is stored in the block and distributed across the network like a chain, in a way that it canâ€™t be changed or hacked. A record of each transaction on the blockchain is publicly recorded to the ledger of every participant.

              <p>
              Computers connected to the network or nodes as they are referred to, add new transcations to the blockchain in chronological order by performing mathematical calculations to generate new blocks containing the transaction information. Cryptographic hashing is used to ensure security of the information held, each block contains the hash used in the previous block which is then hashed.
