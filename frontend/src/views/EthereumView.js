              Ethereum is an open-source, blockchain-based, decentralized platform that is used for its own cryptocurrency, Ether, as well as enabling the use of Smart Contracts and Distributed Applications (ƒêApps) to be built and run without any downtime, fraud, control, or interference from a third party.

              <p>
              The Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) is the runtime environment for smart contracts in Ethereum. It is a 256-bit register stack designed to run the same code exactly as intended. It is the fundamental consensus mechanism for Ethereum.

              <p>
              Ethereum supports Smart Contracts and they are one of the cornestones of the platform. A smart contract is a self-executing contract with the terms of the agreement between buyer and seller being directly written into lines of code. The code and the agreements contained therein exist across a distributed, decentralized blockchain network, which in this case is the Ethereum blockchain.
